# SaviraWood
This is a project showing how SvelteKit and pure Go can be used to make a commercial website. The project has not yet been finished and likely to take a few months, however it is already possible to see (at least in backend) how it comes along.

Backend (especially Models) should work with any projects and works as a great template for future Rest APIs written in pure, unframeworked Go

to build and use backend you can use 

```bash
go build github.com/appleofeden110/SaviraWood

./SaviraWood.exe
```

for now that is it, wait for updates
