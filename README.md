# SaviraWood
This is a project showing how SvelteKit and pure Go can be used to make a commercial website. The project has not yet been finished and likely to take a few months, however it is already possible to see (at least in backend) how it comes along.

Backend (especially Models) should work with any projects and works as a great template for future Rest APIs written in pure, unframeworked Go, with implemented Cart, User and Product CRUD functionality (feel free to change it)

to build and use backend you can use 

```bash
go build github.com/appleofeden110/SaviraWood

./SaviraWood.exe
```

Also you would need to create your .env file with DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD and DB_DATABASE 

Trying to find time to learn Docker properly as well and get everything to work in containers, so it would work in tandem.

for now that is it, wait for updates
